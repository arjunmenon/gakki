# Gakki

I have designed and implemented a mixed architecture chat bot. I named it Gakki.

An example of typical input would be some thing like this:

> **user:** Hello  
> **Gakki:** Hi there!  
> **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?  
> **Gakki:** I am working on the HCI homework, thank you for asking.  
> **user:** How is your candidacy exam?  
> **Gakki:** I failed it!  

## Goal
I have designed and implemented the Gakki, a chat bot to conducts a conversation via text.
Gakki shares many of the same goal as previous chat bot. However, its design has been driven
some limitations of existing chat bots like ELIZA, ALICE, XiaoIce. I have reflected traditional
choices and explored radically different points in the design space.
### Personification
Current chat bots are either Rule-based or Corpus-based. For both of them, they are just some
mixed regular expressions, parsers or complicated machine learning algorithms. Inspired
by cognitive science, I was wondering if I could imitate how human minds work. I try to
name part the corresponding name in human body, which increases code's readability and abstraction
level.
### Simple
I don't have time to write a complicated chat bot. Also, I don't expect the chat bot to 
speak many languages or serve various goals and purposes. I just want to do one task and
make it done in a short time.
### Mixed Model
Existing chat bots are either rules-based or corpus-based.
