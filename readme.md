# Gakki

I have designed and implemented a mixed architecture chat bot. I named it Gakki.

An example of typical input would be some thing like this:

> **user:** Hello
> **Gakki:** Hi there!
> **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?
> **Gakki:** I am working on the HCI homework, thank you for asking.
> **user:** How is your candidacy exam?
> **Gakki:** I failed it!

## Goal
I have designed and implemented the Gakki, a chat bot to conducts a conversation via text.
Gakki shares many of the same goal as previous chat bot. However, its design has been driven
some limitations of existing chat bots like ELIZA, ALICE, XiaoIce. I have reflected traditional
choices and explored radically different points in the design space.
